Be surprised at how fast you can build a web application with a pack of fire.

Packfire is a clean and well-thought framework written in PHP for developers of all walks to scaffold and bring up websites quickly and hassle-free. 

Packfire comes under the long and difficult experiences from the development of web frameworks phpRaise and Samstyle PHP Framework. Many of Packfire's components and features are also based on the designs used in ASP.NET, Java and other popular frameworks.

**Code should be easy to write and simple to read, as it is now on Packfire.**

###Status

Packfire Framework uses [Travis Continuous Integration](http://travis-ci.org/) to build and execute PHPUnit unit testing on each of the `git push` the developers make to the repository with thanks to Github Hooks. The following determines the build status for the latest push and it is definitely okay to be failing. 

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/packfire/packfire-framework.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/packfire/packfire-framework)

We will only release builds that pass the unit tests.

#More information

If you need more information on the source code, do feel free to take a look at the `readme.md` usage guide in directories within the framework directory. We are still in the process of development and writing more documentation and tutorial for the framework (pssst… do help us with the documentations too!).
