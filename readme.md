Packfire is a clean and well thought web framework for developers of all walks to scaffold and bring up websites quickly and hassle-free. You'll be surprised at how fast you can build a web application with a pack of fire.

Packfire comes under the difficult experiences from the development of phpRaise and Samstyle PHP Framework. Many of Packfire's components and features are also based on the designs used in ASP.NET, Java and other popular frameworks.

If you're a fan of anonymous functions and closures, you'll love Packfire. In PHP 5.3, you can take advantage of closures to help write your code in simple and expressive syntax.
