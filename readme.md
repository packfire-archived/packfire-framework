# Packfire Framework for PHP

Packfire is a clean and well thought web framework for developers of all walks to scaffold and bring up websites quickly and hassle-free. 

In PHP 5.3, Packfire takes advantage of closures to let you write your code in simple and expressive syntax. 

Packfire comes under experiences from the development of phpRaise and Samstyle PHP Framework. Some of Packfire's designs are inspired based on the difficulties that its predecessor went through. Many of Packfire's components and features are also based on the designs used in ASP.NET, Java and other popular frameworks.
