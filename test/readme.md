#Packfire Unit Testing
####With PHPUnit
___

This repository contains [unit test cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) where we write testing codes to automatically test for Packfire's classes and methods to make sure that they are working correctly. 

You will need to have [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) installed via PEAR in order to run these test cases on your machine.

If you have any find, any failed test, ... please report it to the [framework repository Issue Page](https://github.com/packfire/framework/issues).
